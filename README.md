## Binary Search Tree Implementation

A C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) using linked storage and recursive algorithms. The program generates a set of unique random values, inserts them into a BST, and displays structural properties and traversal outputs.

## Overview
The program:
- Generates 100 unique random integers in the range 1–200
- Inserts values into a Binary Search Tree
- Computes the height of the tree
- Outputs inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals

This project emphasizes recursive logic, inheritance, and tree-based data structures.

## Features
- Binary Tree base class with Binary Search Tree inheritance
- Recursive insertion and traversal algorithms
- Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
- Tree height calculation
- Linked-node implementation
- Modular driver and Makefile-based build system
